# templayed.js

The **fastest** and **smallest** Mustache compliant Javascript templating library written in **1806 bytes** (uncompressed)

## Introduction

[Mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) is one of the best known Javascript templating libraries out there. I am also using it within several projects. The only downside you could imagine is its size:

* uncompressed: 15050 bytes
* YUI compressed: 5053 bytes
* YUI compressed and gzipped: 2271 bytes

So out of pure curiosity, I have written `templayed.js` to see whether it can be written more compact with the following as result:

* uncompressed: 1806 bytes
* YUI compressed: 1281 bytes
* YUI compressed and gzipped: 643 bytes

It does not have dependencies and it supports the following Mustache.js features:

* variables
* variables accessed through properties of objects using the dot notation
* HTML escaping of variables
* shown / hidden sections
* lists
* current item referrals
* functions
* inverted sections
* comments

This leaves out partials and streaming.

## Benchmarks with Mustache.js, Handlebars.js and Hogan.js

[Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com) is also a well-known Mustache compliant Javascript templating library (uncompressed 49699 bytes) written by Yehuda Katz ([@wycats](https://github.com/wycats)) and it is a bit more extensive than Mustache.js. [Hogan.js](http://twitter.github.com/hogan.js) is the Mustache templating library (uncompressed 15187 bytes) developed by Twitter.

As of version `0.2.0`, templayed.js compiles templates to cached functions for major performance improvements. I have benchmarked Mustache.js, Handlebars.js, Hogan.js and templayed.js.

You can view the results at [Mustache JS engine rumble: Mustache.js vs Handlebars.js vs Hogan.js vs templayed.js](http://jsperf.com/mustache-compliant-libraries/7) in which **templayed.js is pointed out as the fastest library in ALL browsers**!

Open the [benchmark link](http://jsperf.com/mustache-compliant-libraries/7) so you can run the benchmark in your browser yourself.

## Testing templayed.js with QUnit

The `templayed.js` library is tested with [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com). Check out the test results at [http://archan937.github.com/templayed.js/test](http://archan937.github.com/templayed.js/test).

## Installation

Just include templayed.js:

    <script src="path/to/templayed.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

**Note**: include `templayed.min.js` for the minified templayed.js library

## Usage

### Writing templates

If you are familiar with the `Mustache.js` syntax then you are able to write `templayed.js` templates. Read the [Mustache.js documentation](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) if you are not.

### Variable scoping

As of version `0.2.0`, the variable scope handling is altered. You have to use `../` which will evaluate the path against a parent context:

    template  = "<ul>{{#names}}<li>{{../fullName}}</li>{{/names}}</ul>",
    variables = {
      names: [{firstName: "Paul", lastName: "Engel"}, {firstName: "Chunk", lastName: "Norris"}],
      fullName: function() {
        return this.lastName + ", " + this.firstName;
      }
    };
    templayed(template)(variables); //=> "<ul><li>Engel, Paul</li><li>Norris, Chunk</li></ul>";

### Rendering templates

Rendering those templates can be done using `templayed()`.

    templayed("<p>My name is {{name}}!</p>")({name: "Paul Engel"});

### Check current version

You can obtain the library version with the following:

    templayed.version;

## Using templayed.js in node.js

[Helder Santana](https://github.com/heldr) has ported templayed.js for [node.js](http://nodejs.org). Install templayed.js for node.js as follows:

    npm install templayed

See [npmjs/package/templayed](https://npmjs.org/package/templayed) for more information.

## Handlebars.js-ish helpers

The [edge branch](https://github.com/archan937/templayed.js/tree/edge) contains a templayed.js version in which Handlebars.js-ish helpers are implemented.

## Try out templayed.js online yourself

Please visit [http://archan937.github.com/templayed.js](http://archan937.github.com/templayed.js) to try out templayed.js yourself and to check out a series of live examples.

## TODO

* Automatically cache compiled template functions
* Support custom delimiters (e.g. <% %>)
